                                    <p>The objective of National Cadet Corps is to develop character, comradeship, and capacity for leadership among youth in India. NCC at SRM motivates the students with best training and the ideals of selfless service. 
                                    The training inculcates team spirit, a sense of nationalism and it also helps in developing the overall personality of an individual. 
                                    The SRM NCC (Senior Division-SD) under 1 (Tamilnadu) Signal Company NCC [1 (TN) SIG COY NCC] was started in August 1996. 
                                    The first and the second year students are enrolled for the duration of three years. 
                                    We also enroll girls in the NCC since 2005 and the total allotted strength including girls is 83. 
                                    The Obstacle Area was established in the year 2009 to train the cadets. NCC parades are regularly conducted in Dr. T. P. Ganesan Auditorium Ground on every Saturday from 7.00 to 11.00 AM as per Parade Schedule. 
                                    Pre-parade meeting is also conducted in front of the NCC Office on every Friday from 5.30 to 6.30 PM.</p>
